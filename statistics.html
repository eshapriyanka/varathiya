            <p>Over the past few years, Hauz Khas Lake has seen fluctuating pollution levels due to untreated sewage, industrial runoff, and human activities. Earlier, the lake suffered from severe water degradation, marked by high biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), frequent algal blooms, and low dissolved oxygen (DO). While recent efforts like installing water treatment plants and aerators have brought some temporary improvements in water clarity and solid waste reduction, pollution levels continue to rise due to inconsistent maintenance and ongoing wastewater discharge. Despite small improvements, the overall water quality remains a major concern.</p>

            <p>Najafgarh drain, which feeds into the Yamuna River, has been one of the most polluted water bodies in Delhi over the past few decades. Originating as a natural drainage channel, it has turned into a major source of pollution due to the discharge of untreated industrial effluents and domestic sewage. In recent years, efforts such as setting up sewage treatment plants (STPs), strict regulations on industrial waste disposal, and cleanup drives have been part of a larger pollution control strategy. The Delhi government has also worked on rejuvenation projects, aiming to restore the ecological balance of this water body. Though challenges remain, including illegal dumping and unplanned urbanization, these initiatives represent a gradual shift towards reducing pollution levels. The hope is to eventually revitalize Najafgarh and reduce its contribution to the pollution of the Yamuna River.</p>

            <p>The Okhla Bird Sanctuary, located along the Yamuna River, has faced increasing pollution over the past few years due to rapid urbanization and industrial activities in its vicinity. The sanctuary, which is home to a wide variety of migratory birds and wildlife, has been impacted by untreated sewage, industrial waste, and solid garbage from nearby areas, especially from the Najafgarh Drain. This has led to the degradation of water quality and a loss of habitat for many species. However, in recent years, efforts have been made to address the pollution, environmental groups and the government have also launched clean-up campaigns to protect the sanctuary. While the challenges persist, these efforts represent positive steps toward restoring the ecological balance of the Okhla Bird Sanctuary and ensuring it remains a haven for wildlife.</p>

            <p>Purana Qila Lake, located near the historic fort in Delhi, has faced increasing pollution in recent years due to garbage dumping, untreated sewage, and the inflow of contaminated water from nearby sources, including the heavily polluted Yamuna River. Once a peaceful spot for visitors, the lake has suffered from poor water quality and environmental degradation. However, efforts to restore the lake have been initiated, including desilting, improving water filtration, and diverting polluted water sources. These initiatives, alongside environmental awareness campaigns, aim to revive the lake and preserve its natural beauty, ensuring it remains an important cultural and ecological site in Delhi.</p>

            <p>Sanjay Lake, located in East Delhi, has faced rising pollution over the years due to untreated sewage, garbage dumping, and urban encroachment. Once a peaceful recreational spot, the lake’s water quality has deteriorated, impacting both its ecosystem and its attractiveness as a public space. However, recent efforts have focused on reviving the lake, including desilting, installing sewage treatment plants, and organizing clean-up drives. These initiatives aim to restore the lake's ecological balance and preserve it as a vital green space for the local community, though ongoing efforts are still needed to sustain its recovery. Increasing community involvement and awareness about the importance of clean water bodies are crucial for the lake's future.</p>

            <p>The Yamuna River, one of the most significant rivers in northern India, has experienced severe pollution challenges over the past few years, primarily due to industrial waste, untreated sewage, and solid waste disposal from nearby urban areas. Once a lifeline for millions, the river’s water quality has significantly deteriorated, affecting both human health and aquatic ecosystems. Efforts to address these issues have included the establishment of sewage treatment plants, government initiatives to reduce industrial discharge. Despite these efforts, the Yamuna continues to face threats from over-extraction of water and ongoing pollution, making it crucial to work collaboratively to implement sustainable practices. With commitment and innovative solutions, there is hope for rejuvenating the Yamuna River and restoring it to a cleaner, healthier state.</p>
